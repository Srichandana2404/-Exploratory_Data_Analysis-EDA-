Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python. Visualizes survival patterns based on gender, class, age, and embarkment. Includes data cleaning, statistical insights, and clear observations to uncover key factors influencing passenger survival.

# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger survival using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Through visualizations and statistical breakdowns, we examine how factors like gender, class, age, and embarkment location influenced survival outcomes.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of gender, class, age groups, and family size
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Survival rates by gender, class, and embarkment
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Correlation heatmaps and pairplots
- **Visualizations**: Bar charts, boxplots, countplots, and heatmaps
- **Observations**: Markdown insights after each plot
- **Summary**: Final conclusions drawn from the data

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Higher fares and lower class numbers correlated positively with survival.
- Most passengers traveled alone, and embarkment location influenced survival odds.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter  
3. Run all cells from top to bottom  
4. Ensure required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
